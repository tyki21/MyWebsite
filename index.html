<p>Informally known as TK ... </p>
<p>Big Things to Note:</p>
  <p> I am currently a college student at the Illinois Institute of technology. I gradute this coming Spring in May. Most of my time spent
    is working on this website, my blog, and other related projects outside of my regular work day. Considering that I am only in school
    at night I would like to have a job that could teach me the ropes of the IT world. During the summer time I do plan to accquiring a few
    certifications if my budget allows (bills are not nice things).<p>

   <p> Feel free to check out the links above to get to know more about me.<p>
